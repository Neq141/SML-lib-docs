<b>Hi \:D and welcome to SML-lib where <Hidden visible={"small"} hidden={"Smol"}/> we do things to help you code better.</b>

:::tip[Why use C instead of C++?]
C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do, it blows away your whole leg – [**Bjarne Stroustrup**](https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup) (creator of C++)
:::
Before convincing you to use this library We want to tell you why C can still be utilized as a <Hidden visible="modern language" hidden="It's not perfect tho"/>.

## Why C?
### Simplicity and Control:
C is often favored for its simplicity. It provides a minimalistic and straightforward syntax, making it easier to understand and maintain. This simplicity gives you greater control over your code, allowing you to manage memory and resources directly.

### Portability:
C code is highly portable, making it an excellent choice for low-level system programming. C code can be easily compiled and run on various platforms without many modifications, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of hardware and operating systems.

### Efficiency:
C is often more efficient than <Hidden visible="C++" hidden="If you use C/Cpp or even Rust poorly, even pure Python will outperform it"/> in terms of code execution speed and memory usage. This can be crucial in scenarios where every resource counts, such as embedded systems or real-time applications.

### Small Footprint:
C programs tend to have a smaller memory footprint compared to C++ due to the absence of certain C++ features like runtime type information and dynamic dispatch. This makes C a better choice for environments with limited memory.

### No OOP Overhead:
C++, Java, C# ... brings object-oriented programming (OOP) features that are not always needed in every project. If your project doesn't require classes and inheritance, avoiding the overhead of these features by using <Hidden visible="C" hidden="or any functional/procedural/array-based language"/> can be more efficient.

<Hidden visible="OOP" hidden="Object Oriented Programming"/> or not to <Hidden visible="P" hidden="Functional Programming"/> this is the question for most programmers who are starting out in their journey.
And today's tech influences are not doing them a favor. In the end it's not about the language or the framework, it's about getting <Hidden visible={"stuff"} hidden={"sh*t"}/> done and making it fast. If you are conformable with Java and you are getting paid, more power to you. But if you need the edge over your peers here is the <b>way</b>.
