        ### Installing Git on Mac

        Most versions of MacOS will already have Git installed, and you can activate it through the terminal with git
        version. However, if you don't have Git installed for whatever reason, you can install the latest version of Git
        using one of several popular methods as listed below:
        1. Install Git From an Installer

        Navigate to the latest [macOS Git
        Installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/git-2.23.0-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg/download?use_mirror=autoselect)
        and download the latest version.
        Once the installer has started, follow the instructions as provided until the installation is complete.
        Open the command prompt "terminal" and type git version to verify Git was installed.

        > **NOTE**: `git-scm` is a popular and recommended resource for downloading Git on a Mac. The advantage of
        downloading Git from git-scm is that your download automatically starts with the latest version of Git. The
        download source is the same macOS Git Installer as referenced in the steps above.
        Install Git from Homebrew

        2. Homebrew is a popular package manager for macOS. If you already have Homwbrew installed, you can follow the
        below steps to install Git:

        Open up a terminal window and install Git using the following command:
        ```bash
        brew install git.
        ```
        Once the command output has completed, you can verify the installation by typing:

        ```bash
        git version.
        ```

        if it does not give an error well you are ready to install the package!


        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Neq141/SML-Lib .
        ```

        or
        ```bash
        git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Neq141/SML-Lib .
        ```

        ### Install Git on Windows

        1. Navigate to the latest Git for Windows installer and download the latest version.
        2. Once the installer has started, follow the instructions as provided in the Git Setup wizard screen until the
        3. installation is complete.
        4. Open the windows command prompt (or Git Bash if you selected not to use the standard Git Windows Command
        Prompt
        during the Git installation).
        Type `git version` to verify Git was installed.

        ```cmd
        git version
        ```

        > Note: git-scm is a popular and recommended resource for downloading Git for Windows. The advantage of
        downloading Git from git-scm is that your download automatically starts with the latest version of Git included
        with the recommended command prompt, Git Bash . The download source is the same Git for Windows installer as
        referenced in the steps above.
