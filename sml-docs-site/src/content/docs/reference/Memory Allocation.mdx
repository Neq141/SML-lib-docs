## Introduction

The SML C Library provides memory allocation functions for efficient memory management in C applications.
Additionally, it offers error handling capabilities to handle memory allocation failures gracefully.

>This does not mean that this library make C typesafe or anything. It's actually anything but that.
At this moment, It just allows you to remove the syntactic sugar to make the code safe.

Basically your code goes from this,
```c
#ifdef DEBUG
int* arr = (int*) calloc(5, sizeof(int));
#else
int* arr = (int*) malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
#endif

if (arr == NULL){
    fprinf(stderr, "Uh Oh. (-_-)");
}
```

to this.
```c
// errors_and_logging.c
#define DEBUG 1
```

```
// your_good_code.c
int* arr = sml_alloc(5, sizeof(int));
```
as you can see, this allows for more readable code and easier debugging.

:::tip[Extensibility]
This module's behavior changes on which library's you have included. Including `errors_and_debugging.h` in your main code
will result in better error messages but is not a necessity.

## Memory Allocation Functions

### `sml_alloc`
> glorified switch statement between `sml_malloc()` and `sml_calloc()`

The `sml_alloc` function allocates memory for a specified amount of data, checking for overflow and underflow.
And changes behavior on `#define DEBUG`'s property. If your program is on debug mode all your memory allocation from this function will be redirected to
`sml_calloc`. if not they will be redirected to `sml_malloc()`.

```c
void *sml_alloc(unsigned long long how_much, unsigned long long sizeof_mem);
```


### `sml_calloc()`

a wrapper around `calloc()` that checks for data validity.

```c
void *sml_calloc(unsigned long long how_much, unsigned long long sizeof_mem);
```

### `sml_malloc()`

a wrapper around `malloc()` that checks for data validity.

```c
void *sml_malloc(unsigned long long size);
```

### `sml_realloc`

a wrapper around `realloc()` that checks for data validity.
```c
void *sml_realloc(void *ptr, unsigned long long new_requested_size);
```

### `sml_realloc_s()`

`sml_realloc`'s neighbor but she is way more stubborn. If it encounters an error. It will try to literally try to relocate
the memory to a different position in memory to not let your program fail. Truly one of the functions of all time

```c
void *sml_realloc_s(void *ptr, unsigned long long new_requested_size);
```
