## Math Macros
First things first Macros. Every good library has them.

###### `#define SML_IS_UNSIGNED(x) ((x) >= 0)`
Checks if x is an unsigned integer.

###### `#define SML_IS_ODD(x) ((x) % 2 != 0)`
Checks if x is an odd integer.

###### `#define SML_IS_EVEN(x) ((x) % 2 == 0)`
Checks if x is an even integer.

###### `#define SML_GET_FLOAT_OF_FLOATING(x) ((x) - (int)(x))`
Extracts the fractional part of a floating-point number x.

###### `#define SML_GET_WHOLE_OF_FLOATING(x) ((int)(x))`
Extracts the whole part of a floating-point number x.

###### `#define SML_IS_NUMBER(x) ((x) - (int)(x) == 0)`
Checks if a number is _well_ a number

## Math Types
### Structs


```c
typedef struct sml_math_t {
#ifdef HIGH_ACCURACY
    long double value;
    long double degree;
#else
    double value;
    double degree; // ie. degree.th root of val
#endif
    sml_num_type type; // ie. sqrt/imaginary or not
    bool is_imaginary; // I mean it can be sqrt(-1) so its both a sqrt and imaginary
    struct sml_math_t *related; // this is for adding ie. 3sqrt(5) or i5 + 3
} sml_math_t;
```
### Enums
```c
typedef enum {
_int = 0, _float, _irrational, _imaginary, _degree, _radian, _gradian
} sml_num_type;
```
